An open source USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat.

I started this project because I needed a potentiostat/galvanostat that suited my research on thin-film lithium-ion batteries. Commercial offers exist, but even a basic model will easily set you back €6000. Moreover, I didn't like dealing with closed, non-user-serviceable hardware and putting up with the manufacturer's buggy software. So I designed and built my own, for a parts cost of about €50.

This repository contains everyting necessary to replicate the design. It consists of a circuit schematic and PCB layout made with KiCad, microcontroller firmware and source code, and a demonstration program in Labview to run typical electrochemical measurements. More information can be found on the Wiki.
